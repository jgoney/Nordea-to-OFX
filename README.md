# Nordea to OFX converter
by Justin Goney
-----------------------

This simple utility is meant for converting Nordea transaction lists
(downloadable from netbank as CSV) to OFX files for use with personal finance
software, such as Quicken. Run this from the command line with one or more
CSV files as arguments, and nordea_to_ofx will create one OFX file in the
current directory for each CSV file that it processes.

Usage: nordea_to_ofx.py [some_nordea_csv]
